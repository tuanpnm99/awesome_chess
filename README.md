In this game, the player will play with a AI agent which used minmax algorithm to search for the future states and decides which is the best move to make. However, since the chess's game states are so large that it will take very long for the computer to make the brute force search all of the states, some optimization has been made to address this issue. The agent will prune the search to remove unnecessary search and search in the time limit before evaluate the current state using the given board configuration.
